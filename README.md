## Origin

<h4>Amayan Club is a decentralized club from Mayan civilization inheritors and crypto community enthusiasts to make your NFTs flow and make your Web3 world colorful.</h4>

Captain Anthony and the crew of Albert, Tud and others, started and designed this new campaign, which will explore the continuation and development of the Mayan civilization with the community. Although the Mayan civilization has disappeared for hundreds of years, it is still an outstanding representative of the ancient Indian civilization in the Americas. Some members of our team are not only the inheritors and beneficiaries of the Mayan civilization, but also artists, engineers, scientists, and trend culture leaders in some fields. It is the arrival of Web3 encryption art, we have the opportunity to combine thousands of elements and visual features into a collection of 10,000 NFTs (non-fungible tokens) through words, numbers, astronomy, beliefs, culture, etc., including gods, priests, commoners , skeletons, aliens, elves, souls, lightning people, apes, mascots, souvenirs, modern life scenes, etc.

Amayan Club community will continue to grow, not only will it launch its own genesis NFT series, but there will also be artist derivatives tools and trading markets. Imagine your NFT appearing on a fashion brand or some derivative products, which is much more interesting than simply hanging on [OpenSea](//opensea.io) or lying in your wallet, and even more exciting is that you can also share and earn some royalties and income. There is also a surprise, just imagine that your NFT can multiply with a certain model of NFT blue-chip brand ([BAYC](//opensea.io/collection/boredapeyachtclub), [CryptoPunks](//opensea.io/collection/cryptopunks), [Meebits](//opensea.io/collection/meebits), [CLONE X](//opensea.io/collection/clonex), [Azuki](//opensea.io/collection/azuki), etc.) to create a brand new DNA NFT, wow, what a wonderful experience, all derived NFTs can be sold on our trading market or [OpenSea](//opensea.io), and then some commercial brands we cooperate with may find your NFT, purchase it and produce some physical and derivative products.

All Genesis NFT collectors will not only have access to advanced digital experiences, but also have the opportunity to participate in offline parties, exhibitions, music festivals, street cultural events and more. At the same time, we have also begun to prepare the independent IP of Amayan Studio, and plan to cooperate and co-brand with fashion brands, such as FILA, GUCCI, Prada, Adidas, etc. In the future, we will also implant your NFT and brand elements in the game scene and metaverse space to help users establish new expressions and social opportunities in the Web3 community.

The most exciting thing, in order to pay tribute to a team we like, [Yuga Labs](https://yuga.com), we will also grant all Amayan Club NFT holders full community commercial rights, and holders can arbitrarily carry out secondary creation, derivative, processing, realization, etc. This belongs to you NFT assets.

## Vision

> Accelerate the mobility of civilization and empower more real value for Web3 scenarios.

## Values

> Civilization Empowerment
<p>Although everything can be NFT, we don't want to see NFT only stay in the stage of PFP, so we will explore the application of NFT in digital exhibition halls、games、social、metaverse and other tracks, so that the value of civilization can be empowered to more Web3 space.</p>

> Community and Users come first
<p>Only when the community and users reach a consensus economy, will the product have continuous daily activity and growth momentum. Therefore, we not only serve users, but also build some tools and infrastructure for the entire Web3 ecosystem. Please believe in the underlying protocols and the value of on-chain data.</p>
